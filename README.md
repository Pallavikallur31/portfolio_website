## Technology Stack & Architecture
This portfolio website leverages a robust and widely adopted set of frontend technologies, coupled with modern DevOps practices:

*   **Frontend Core:** HTML5, CSS3 (`style.css`, `404.css`), and Vanilla JavaScript (`app.js`, `script.js`, `404.js`).
*   **Dynamic Styling & Effects:** Advanced CSS for modern aesthetics and `particles.min.js` for engaging background animations.
*   **Declarative Content:** JSON files (`projects.json`, `skills.json`) serve as local data stores for easily managing project and skill information without a traditional database.
*   **DevOps:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for automated builds and deployments (e.g., to GitHub Pages).
*   **Development Environment:** Configured with `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent code quality and developer experience.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This project functions as a static site, meaning there is no traditional server-side architecture or backend database. Instead, content is loaded dynamically via client-side JavaScript from local JSON files. Below is a high-level representation of the user's interaction flow with the website:
